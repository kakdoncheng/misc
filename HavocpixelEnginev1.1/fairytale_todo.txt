IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BE IMPLEMENTED ASAP:
  Change camera & entity handling:
    Change as follows:
       Add tag for entities which signal camera focus
       Always render and update entities that have camera focus
       Update camera position first before rendering anything else

  Adding new monsters/objects:
    Corpse Trees,
    Gelatinous Cubes,
    Unarmed Zombies
    

  WarpPortal:
    Stores an entity, teleports them anywhere they wish on a map
    with little delay.
    two locations, initial and final
    delay
    two different spriteworks
    particale


  In havocpixel.WorldManager:
    Change teleportTo() method to changeWorld()
    have the method only deal with changing the world
    changing the game.$player() location should be done in the trigger method

  Test the LeaveArea objects to see if they still work:
    Test player & attach it to worlds

  Make new worlds

  Implement big creatures/greater demons:
    textures will be bigger
    smarter, multiple attack animations
    may have special actions

  Implement bosses:
    textures will be bigger
    actions will be the same, however, patterns of attack and movement are more complex
    might change music
    might have dialogue


CHANGES TO COME LATER:
  Use of LWJGL to render textures;

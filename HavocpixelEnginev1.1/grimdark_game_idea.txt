is a grimdark fantasy medieval-era game where the world is on verge of falling to chaos
there will be various factions trying to decide how to stop the eventual calamity, but it will be up to the player to decide which path to take
of course, some of the factions are evil
some are well-meaning
but all of them will be in the extremes
there will only be one gray area of action and that will turn into a very dark path

FACTIONS:
Northern Kingdom - King is aging, and eventually turns into puppet as right hand man attempts to use the calamity as a coup to throw him off power and turn the kingdom into a dystopian, dictatorial state.
Harbringers of Doom - four individuals who seek power to bring down the world into chaos, with them ruling.
Band of the Hawk - one of the many armies of the midland who strive to bring peace by defeating the calamity.
Knights Templar - a religous sect that undiscriminately persecutes commoners and nobles alike, blaming them for the calamity and executing them.


ENDINGS: 
Death - You die prematurely, and the whole world turns to chaos as the factions tear each other apart.
Order - You help the midland kingdom, and get backstabbed by the right hand man as he fears you. You start out doing positive actions that benifit the kingdom, but eventually start commiting atrocites and the such which make you waiver in faith. After you kill one of the possessed you realize that the right hand man was the cause of it all and decide to frame you for the murder of the king, which leads to you dying in a shootout.
Chaos - You help the harbringers bring the world to chaos, and get corrupted by chaos.
Honorable Death - You die defending the band of the hawk.
Genocide - You have killed everyone and everything as you decided you hate the world and become a vessel of chaos.

its set in the fantasy medeval period
you reside on a group of islands that are close enough to the mainland to be part of the main country residing there, but far enough to be easily isolated
the islands have been peaceful following a war a long time ago, but some years before you are born, monsters and demons have been seen ravaging the landscape and terrorizing other people with increasing freqeuncy every year
people on the island have been calling it the "calamity"
in fact you were orphaned while you were 7 following an demonic attack in your village, where you witnessed your parents bieng torn to shreds as a little kid
10 years later, the problem only got worse, and eventually, following the first massive wave of demons to invade the island, the main lord who is in charge of governing the islands make a call to arms againstthe monsters
you fight your way to the main city alongside your childhood buddy (and/or love interest idk which yet) after the first wave decimates your village
upon reaching there, you meet with the governor who is about to assign you to a unit to attack when the second wave hits and destroys the city
in the combat,your buddy is killed, and youare furious
being the only warrior left that can actually do something, you don armor and get a bigger sword as you learn from the head wizard that the source of the invasion came from the farthest corner in your island
note that the only populated island is the main one btw
upon fighting your way there you find yourself at an abandoned mansion where the instigator of the demon invasion is

you head into the main room of the mansion and see someone who you assume to be the one responsible and start to wonder why they would do such a thing
the person turns around, and its [you love interest]
they sees you, and correctly identifies you as the human who has been massacring the monsters around the island
//as he keeps talking, anyone whos played undertale realized that the peaceful mode did not have a happy ending
//after monsters and humans reintergrated, they were distrustful of one another
//until something happened that tipped the humans over the edge

after which, the humans lauched a preemptive attack on the monsters, mass slaughtering them
//Sans was one of the only ones that survived
he explains that one time, he might have hoped for someone like you to turn their hearts
but then he lost all hope of that after the humans started destroying everything
//he then leads you into the mansion to the chair where toriel sat and was killed, with the bloodstains still there
//he then explains that he doesnt intend to keep any promises to her any longer, and the you have a bossfight with sans
if you lose, the civilization of the humans get destroyed
if you win you stop sans and the invasions
however, realizing what he and his kind had done, he kills himself amongst returning as a hero

sometime during the trip to the castle, your love interest gets lost
you travel to find her and find out shes been abducted my the monsters
as you storm the cave where she is kept, you realize she got stockholm syndrome
she is very idsorentated and is terrified that you destroyed the monster's home
she goes mia at the castle invasion and your buddy is killed
